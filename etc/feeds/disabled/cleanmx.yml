# This cif-smrt configuration file is an example on how
# to parse a XML feed but should not used as CleanMX
# is known to timeout on large XML queries. The remote
# URL below defaults to returning 100 results.
#
# A better solution is to install the CleanMX CIF Application
# found here:
#
# https://github.com/csirtgadgets/py-cifcleanmx
#
# This application leverages the ability to request a delta
# since the last time CIF queried CleanMX. Using the CleanMX
# CIF Application, you will experience less HTTP timeouts
# and ultimately obtain the data served up by CleanMX.
